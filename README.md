# "JSONPlaceholder-API" - public test API
"REST Client for Visual Studio Code" extension
Goal was: investigate if the extension can be used for API testing in situation where Postman, SoapUI or any other common free tool canÂ´t be installed/used in test environment.
Result: it can be used only manually, for basic checks, because there is not implemented possibility to run rsequence of requests (more than 1 request).
