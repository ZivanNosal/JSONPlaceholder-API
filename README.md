# "JSONPlaceholder-API" - public test API
requests for "REST Client for Visual Studio Code" extension

Goal was: investigate if the extension can be used for API testing in situation where Postman, SoapUI or any other common free tool can´t be installed/used in test environment.

Result: it can be used only manually, for basic checks, because there is not implemented possibility to run sequence of requests (more than 1 request).
